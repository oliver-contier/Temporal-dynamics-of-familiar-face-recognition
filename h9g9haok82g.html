<div>The neural system underlying human face processing  consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of  visual features of a face, and an extended system involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>. A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, that is how their role in the neural representation of faces changes over time. In this study, we aim to investigate  habituation and sensitisation of familiarity effects in the distributed system of face processing and disentangle the contribution  the response to familiar and unfamiliar faces to these effects.</div>
