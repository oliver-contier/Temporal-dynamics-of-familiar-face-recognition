<div>For the intercept of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar we found significant clusters of activation bilaterally in the MTG/STS  as well as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the &nbsp;cingulate gyrus (CG), and the precuneus.&nbsp;Additional, we found right hemispheric activation in the anterior portion of the STS, &nbsp;the anterior fusiform gyrus, and the inferior frontal cortex as well as the left middle fusiform gyrus.</div><div>The reversed intercept of this contrast (i.e. the intercept of Unfamiliar &gt; Familiar) showed no significant results. There were also no significant clusters for the slope of Familliar &gt; Unfamiliar, but&nbsp;</div><div>The reversed slope of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar yielded a bilateral  cluster of activation in the posterior cingulate gyri (with parts of the paracingulate gyrus and posterior portion of anterior cingulate gyrus). Additionally, we found a significant cluster in the right inferior frontal cortex, spanning the right IFG, frontal opercular cortex, and insula. A third significant cluster spanned the right posterior MTG, lateral occipital cortex, and middle fusiform gyrus.</div><div>There were no significant clusters for the&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
