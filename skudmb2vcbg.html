<div>Furthermore,  visually induced familiarity has been shown to evoke increased activity in the  precuneus - an area associated with long-term memory retrieval (Burgess et al.,  2001) and imagery (Fletcher et al., 1995; Ishai, Ungerleider, &amp; Haxby,  2000). It has therefore been framed as a module involved in representing  episodic memories linked to a familiar face (2007). We therefore expect  activity of the precuneus in response to unfamiliar faces to increase during  the course of the experiment, resulting in a diminished contrast between the response  to familiar and unfamiliar faces in this region.</div>
