<div>Two previous fMRI studies have focused on the changes in familiarity effects over a longer time scale (<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Gobbini_2006}</cite>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Kosaka_2003}</cite>).&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Kosaka_2003}</cite> have investigated how the response to unfamiliar faces habituates over their experiment, which comprised of several functional runs. They found habituation effects in the right amygdala and left fusiform gyrus. The bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus however showed an increase of activity as the experiment proceeded.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Gobbini_2006}</cite>&nbsp;on the other hand manipulated visual familiarity experimentally. Participants learned the visual appearance of initially unfamiliar faces in a behavioural task preceding an fMRI session. While visual familiarity led to a decrease of the response in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus, the  precuneus showed an increased response.</div>
