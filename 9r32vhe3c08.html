<div>Two previous fMRI studies have focused on the changes in familiarity effects over a longer time scale (<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Gobbini_2006}</cite>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Kosaka_2003}</cite>).&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Kosaka_2003}</cite> have investigated how the response to unfamiliar faces habituates over their experiment, which comprised of several functional runs. They found habituation effects in the right amygdala and left fusiform gyrus. The bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus however showed an increase of activity as the experiment proceeded.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Gobbini_2006}</cite>&nbsp;on the other hand manipulated visual familiarity experimentally. Participants learned the visual appearance of initially unfamiliar faces in a behavioural task preceding an fMRI session. While visual familiarity led to a decrease of the response in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus, the  precuneus showed an increased response. It should be noted however that the anatomical location of this latter activation cluster also spanned parts of the posterior cingulate gyrus.&nbsp;A more recent study&nbsp;by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Natu_2015}</cite>  provided further evidence that face-sensitive areas in the fusiform gyrus contain useful patterns for classifying visually familiar versus unfamiliar faces.&nbsp;Together these results suggest that the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and amygdala are involved in the acquisition of visual familiarity in face perception.&nbsp;</div>
