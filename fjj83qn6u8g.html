<h2 data-label="383681" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>To investigate which condition is driving this habituation of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar, we also added  One-Sample T-Tests for familiar and unfamiliar face stimuli to the first level analysis seperately. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{786151}</span> shows the reversed slopes of these simple main effects, which represent a habituation of the response to familiar and unfamiliar faces respectively. We found no significant clusters for the positive slope&nbsp;of either the familiar or unfamiliar condition.</div><div>For the habituation of the response to familiar faces (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{786151}</span> A), we found significant clusters in the right IFG, insula, and posterior MTG which overlap with the clusters from the habituation of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar. Additional clusters of activation span the left occipital fusiform gyrus, the left parietal operculum cortex, as well as the lateral occipital cortex, and the&nbsp;superior parietal lobule bilaterally. For the habituation of the response to unfamiliar faces (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{786151}</span> B), significant clusters of activation were found in the right temporal occipital fusiform cortex, the dorsal part of the precuneus, and the left lateral occipital cortex. None of these clusters overlapped with the habituation found for the contrast of Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar.</div><h2 data-label="383681" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2>
