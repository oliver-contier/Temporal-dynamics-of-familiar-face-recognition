<div>So far, studies investigating  changes in the response to faces largely used paradigms like repetition suppression and adaptation (e.g. EEG repetition suppression in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citealp*{Caharel_2011}"><a href="#Caharel_2011">Caharel, Jacques, dArripe, Ramon, and Rossion, 2011</a></cite>; fMRI adaptation in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citealp*{Eger_2005}"><a href="#Eger_2005">Eger, Schweinberger, Dolan, and Henson, 2005</a></cite>; more references in these two papers). However, such methods zoom in on changes on a very short time scale and effects are generally interpreted more in terms of functional localisation but are not very informative to the question of how the neural representation of face familiarity changes over a longer and possible more naturalistic time scale.&nbsp;</div>
