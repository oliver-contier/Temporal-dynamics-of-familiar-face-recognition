<div>The amygdala - an area associated with the  evaluation of emotionally relevant stimuli (Breiter et al., 1996; Canli et al.,  2002; Morris et al., 1996; Zalla et al., 2000) - has been shown to respond more  strongly to unfamiliar than familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2004; Leibenluft et  al., 2004). This has been interpreted as a state of alertness when encountering  an unfamiliar person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2007). However, this effect has been  known to decrease upon repetition of the stimulus (Dubois et al., 1999, Kosaka  et al., 2003; Schwarz et al., 2003).</div>
