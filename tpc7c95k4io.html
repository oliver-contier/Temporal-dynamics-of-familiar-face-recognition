<h2></h2><div>Progression over runs:</div><div>To investigate the time course / progression of the observed habituation effects, we extracted the mean parameter estimates within the thresholded clusters found in the reversed slope of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar from the  first level analysis. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span> shows that the respective progression of these</div><div>contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar is significantly greater than zero during the first three runs and decreases during the following runs, being significantly below zero in runs 8 and 10.</div><div></div>
