<h2></h2><div>Progression over runs:</div><div>To further explore the time course of the responses to unfamiliar faces, familiar faces as well as the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar, we extracted the mean parameter estimates within the thresholded clusters found in the reversed slope of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{563705}</span> B) from the  first level analysis. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>&nbsp;shows the mean parameter estimates within these regions per run for all  subjects. </div><div>The contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>, right panel) generally decreases during the course of the experiment, with pronounced positive values above zero during the first three runs and negative values during runs eight and ten.&nbsp;</div><div>Familiar:</div><div>The response to familiar faces (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>, left panel) is marked by an abrupt decrease after run four with otherwise&nbsp;</div><ul><li>"sudden" decrease after run four</li><li>steady within runs 1-4 and 5-11</li></ul><div>Unfamiliar:</div><ul><li>weird.</li></ul><div></div>
