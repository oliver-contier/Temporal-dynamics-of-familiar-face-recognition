<h2></h2><h2 data-label="279914" class="ltx_title_subsection">Mean parameter estimates</h2><div>To further explore the time course of the observed habituation effects, we extracted the mean parameter estimates from the results of the first level analysis within the clusters of the reversed slope of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{563705}</span> B).&nbsp;</div><div>within the thresholded clusters found in the reversed slope of the contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{563705}</span> B) from the  first level analysis. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>&nbsp;shows the mean parameter estimates within these regions per run for all  subjects. The contrast Familiar &gt; Unfamiliar (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>, right panel) generally decreases during the course of the experiment, with pronounced positive values above zero during the first three runs and negative values during runs eight and ten.&nbsp;The response to familiar faces (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>, left panel) is marked by an abrupt decrease after run four with otherwise relative stability during the experiment. On the other hand, the response to unfamiliar faces (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{249356}</span>, left panel) appear to be relatively stable over the course of the experiment with the exception of peaks in run 4 and 10.</div><div></div>
