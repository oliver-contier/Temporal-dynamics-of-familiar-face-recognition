The simulated data was designed to contain topologically distinct signals for both an average and habitual effect of familiarity. This way, it provided an opportunity to test if our expanded second level  model could differentiate between these two kinds of signals.</div><div>The code used for this data simulation can be found in the scripts&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_functions.py</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_main.py</i> and uses functions from PyMVPA <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Hanke_2009}</cite>.</div><div>First, a noise image was produced. For each functional run, an initial motion correction was performed&nbsp;using FSL's MCFLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite> as implemented in Nipype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gorgolewski_2011}</cite>. A mean image was then computed for each functional run by averaging each voxel over its time points. This mean image was re-expanded to its original number of time points by adding temporally autocorrelated noise to each voxel.</div><div>The stimulus onsets for familiar and unfamiliar faces from the respective functional runs were convolved with a double-gamma function to model a BOLD response. To model an effect of familiarity, the amplitudes of these BOLD responses were chosen to be 8% signal change for familiar faces and 1% for unfamiliar faces respectively.</div><div>This modelled signal was then added to two arbitrarily selected ROIs defined in MNI space (radius = 10 mm; [x, y, z] coordinates were [10, - 94, &nbsp;4] and [14, 44, 12]) and projected into subject space using FSL's FLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite>. For one of these ROIs, a habituation of the familiarity effect was mimicked by  increasing the amplitude of the modelled response to unfamiliar faces by 0.5 % signal change with each run number.</div><ul><li>Details about transformation method of ROI mask.
