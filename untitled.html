<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of  visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div></div><div><span>Previous studies on habituation, adaptation, and learning:</span></div><div><span>So far, studies investigating such changes in the response to faces largely used paradigms like repetition suppression and adaptation (e.g. EEG repetition suppression in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Caharel_2011}</cite>; fMRI adaptation in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Eger_2005}</cite>; more references in these two papers). However, such methods zoom in on changes on a very short time scale and effects are generally interpreted more in terms of functional localisation but are not very informative to the question of how the neural representation of face familiarity changes over a longer and possible more naturalistic time scale.&nbsp;</span></div><div>Two previous fMRI studies have focused on the changes in familiarity effects over a longer time scale (<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Gobbini_2006}</cite>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Kosaka_2003}</cite>).</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Kosaka_2003}</cite> have investigated how the response to unfamiliar faces habituates over their experiment, which comprised of several functional runs. They found habituation effects in the right amygdala and left fusiform gyrus. The bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus however showed an increase of activity as the experiment proceeded.&nbsp;</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Gobbini_2006}</cite>&nbsp;on the other hand manipulated visual familiarity experimentally. Participants learned the visual appearance of initially unfamiliar faces in a behavioural task preceding an fMRI session. While visual familiarity led to a decrease of the response in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus, the  precuneus showed an increased response.</div><div>It should be noted however that the anatomical location of this latter activation cluster also spanned parts of the posterior cingulate gyrus.&nbsp;</div><div>A more recent study&nbsp;by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citet*{Natu_2015}"><a href="#Natu_2015">Natu and OToole (2015)</a></cite> has provided further evidence that face-sensitive areas in the fusiform gyrus contain useful patterns for classifying visually familiar versus unfamiliar faces.&nbsp;</div>
