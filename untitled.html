<h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of the visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006)</div><h1 data-label="980974" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>We reanalyzed an existing fMRI dataset described fully in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. During the fMRI sessions, 33 participants were presented with pictures of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces while engaged in an oddball task. &nbsp;For a complete description of the participants, stimuli, procedure and image acquisition see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. Of importance for this reanalysis is that the scanning sessions comprised of eleven functional runs which enabled us to model habituation effects over the course of the experiment (see GLM analysis).&nbsp;</div>
