<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of the visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006)</div><h1 data-label="980974" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>We reanalyzed an existing fMRI dataset described fully in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. During the fMRI sessions, 33 participants were presented with pictures of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces while engaged in an oddball task. &nbsp;For a complete description of the participants, stimuli, procedure, image acquisition and preprocessing steps see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. Of importance for this reanalysis is that the scanning sessions comprised of eleven functional runs which allowed us to model habituation effects over the course of the experiment in form of an extended second level model (see GLM analysis).&nbsp;</div><ul><li>preregistration</li><li>What changed/was added after preregistration</li></ul><h2 data-label="416316" class="ltx_title_subsection">GLM analysis</h2><div>Our confirmatory analysis comprised of a  hierarchical general linear model (GLM).

To this end, the run number was introduced to the model as a regressor in addition to a simple averaging regressor. This effectively resulted in a model with an intercept and a slope, where the intercept is intended to capture the average effect of familiarity and the slope a linear change over the course of the experiment.

The simulated data was designed to contain topologically distinct signals for both an average and habitual effect of familiarity. This way, it provided an opportunity to test if our expanded second level  model could differentiate between these two kinds of signals.</div><div>The code used for this data simulation can be found in the scripts&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_functions.py</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_main.py</i> and uses functions from PyMVPA <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Hanke_2009}</cite>.</div><div>First, a noise image was produced. For each functional run, an initial motion correction was performed&nbsp;using FSL's MCFLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite> as implemented in Nipype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gorgolewski_2011}</cite>. A mean image was then computed for each functional run by averaging each voxel over its time points. This mean image was re-expanded to its original number of time points by adding temporally autocorrelated noise to each voxel.</div><div>The stimulus onsets for familiar and unfamiliar faces from the respective functional runs were convolved with a double-gamma function to model a BOLD response. To model an effect of familiarity, the amplitudes of these BOLD responses were chosen to be 8% signal change for familiar faces and 1% for unfamiliar faces respectively.</div><div>This modelled signal was then added to two arbitrarily selected ROIs defined in MNI space (radius = 10 mm; [x, y, z] coordinates were [10, - 94, &nbsp;4] and [14, 44, 12]) and projected into subject space using FSL's FLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite>. For one of these ROIs, a habituation of the familiarity effect was mimicked by  increasing the amplitude of the modelled response to unfamiliar faces by 0.5 % signal change with each run number.</div><ul><li>Details about transformation method of ROI mask.
