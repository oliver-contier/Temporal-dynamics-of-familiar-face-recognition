<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of the visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006)</div><h1 data-label="980974" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>We reanalysed an existing fMRI dataset described fully in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. During the fMRI sessions, 33 participants were presented with pictures of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces while engaged in an oddball task. &nbsp;For a complete description of the participants, stimuli, procedure, image acquisition and preprocessing steps see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. Of particular importance for this reanalysis was that the scanning sessions comprised of eleven functional runs which allowed us to model habituation effects over the course of the experiment in form of an extended second level model&nbsp;(see GLM analysis).</div><h2 data-label="300283" class="ltx_title_subsection">Preregistration</h2><div>In order to draw a clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory results, the code for the data simulation and the confirmatory GLM analysis was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (<a href="https://osf.io/xj5cz/">https://osf.io/xj5cz/</a>).&nbsp;</div><div>What changed/was added after preregistration?</div><ul><li>Simple main effects for familiar and unfamiliar faces were added to the first level analysis</li><li>Regions of interests were defined on the basis of local maxima and mean parameter estimates per run were derived.</li></ul><h2 data-label="416316" class="ltx_title_subsection">GLM analysis</h2><div>Our confirmatory analysis comprised of a  hierarchical general linear model (GLM). The first and third level analysis were performed analogous to the GLM analysis in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>.</div><div>The second-level analysis (fixed-effects) was extended to model  differences between the functional runs within each subject. To this end, the run number was introduced to the second level model as a regressor in addition to a simple averaging regressor. This effectively resulted in a model with an intercept and a slope, where the intercept is intended to capture the average effect of familiarity and the slope a linear change over the course of the experiment. A One-Sample T-Test was performed on the intercept and slope for each contrast from the first level analysis and the resulting statistical maps were passed on to the third level analysis.</div><ul><li>Mention Software and Code used for GLM analysis.&nbsp;</li></ul>
