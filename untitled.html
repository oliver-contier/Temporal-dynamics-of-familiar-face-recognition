<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of  visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><h2 data-label="602375" class="ltx_title_subsection">Learning of unfamiliar faces (induced visual familiarity)</h2><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006).</div><h2 data-label="718029" class="ltx_title_subsection">Habituation of familiar faces</h2><div>Similarly, the neural response to familiar faces might habituate over time in some of these areas; this possible neural adaptation has been largely ignored in previous studies. In this project, we want to investigate the temporal dynamics of core and extend system areas by extending the analysis on a previously acquired fMRI dataset where subjects were presented with personally familiar and unfamiliar faces. Our project will aim at further disentangling the roles of the areas associated with familiar face processing.</div><h2 data-label="156016" class="ltx_title_subsection">Hypotheses</h2><ol><li>As unfamiliar faces are repeatedly presented over the course of an experiment, we expect them to become increasingly visually familiar. We therefore predict that the contrast between the response to &nbsp;familiar vs. unfamiliar faces will decrease over time in the FFA (fusiform face area ; Kanwisher et al., 1997).</li><li>Visually induced familiarity has also been shown to evoke increased activity in the precuneus (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006). We aim to replicate this effect and hence predict a decrease of the contrast between the response of to familiar and unfamiliar faces in the precuneus.</li><li>In previous analysis of this dataset, we have not observed any effect of familiarity in the amygdalaâ€”an area that is usually associated with the evaluation of familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2004; Leibenluft et al., 2004). We predict that by better modeling the habituation effects, we &nbsp;will be able to detect an effect of familiarity in the amygdala, with greater response to unfamiliar than familiar faces.</li></ol><h2 data-label="160915" class="ltx_title_subsection">benefits of reanalysis</h2><div>To address these hypotheses we reanalysed an existing fMRI dataset from an experiment where subjects were presented with personally familiar and unfamiliar faces. The dataset is described fully in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>.&nbsp;By addressing new hypotheses while reusing previously collected and analyzed data, we hoped to not only obtain a better value of the acquired and shared dataset, but also possibly to avoid new bugs and errors which could be present if new data was collected.</div><h1 data-label="980974" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>We reanalysed an existing fMRI dataset from an experiment where 33 participants (mean age 23 y.o. +/- 3.33 SD, 13 males)<b>&nbsp;</b>were presented with pictures of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces while engaged in an oddball task. &nbsp;For a complete description of the participants, stimuli, procedure, image acquisition and preprocessing steps see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>.
