<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of the visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006).</div><div></div><ul><li>benefits of reanalysis</li></ul><div>To address these hypotheses we reanalysed an existing fMRI dataset from an experiment where subjects were presented with personally familiar and unfamiliar faces. The dataset is described fully in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet*{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>.&nbsp;By addressing new hypotheses while reusing previously collected and analyzed data, we hoped to not only obtain a better value of the acquired and shared dataset, but also possibly to avoid new bugs and errors which could be present if new data was collected.</div><h1 data-label="980974" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>We reanalysed an existing fMRI dataset from an experiment where 33 participants were presented with pictures of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces while engaged in an oddball task. &nbsp;For a complete description of the participants, stimuli, procedure, image acquisition and preprocessing steps see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. Of particular importance for this reanalysis was that the scanning sessions comprised of eleven functional runs which allowed us to model habituation effects over the course of the experiment in form of an extended second level model&nbsp;(see GLM analysis).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="300283" class="ltx_title_subsection">Preregistration</h2><div>In order to draw a clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory results, the code for the data simulation and the confirmatory GLM analysis was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (<a href="https://osf.io/xj5cz/">https://osf.io/xj5cz/</a>).&nbsp;Additional exploratory analyses included adding simple main effects (One-Sample T-Test) for familiar and unfamiliar faces to the  first level analysis of the GLM as well as an exploratory ROI analysis.</div><h2 data-label="416316" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="416316" class="ltx_title_subsection">GLM analysis</h2><div>Our confirmatory analysis comprised of a  hierarchical general linear model (GLM). The first and third level analysis were performed analogous to the GLM analysis in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Visconti_di_Oleggio_Castello_2017}</cite>. The second-level analysis (fixed-effects) was extended to model  differences between the functional runs within each subject. To this end, the run number was introduced to the second level model as a regressor in addition to a simple averaging regressor. This effectively resulted in a model with an intercept and a slope, where the intercept is intended to capture the average effect of familiarity and the slope a linear change over the course of the experiment. A One-Sample T-Test was performed on the intercept and slope for each contrast from the first level analysis and the resulting statistical maps were passed on to the third level analysis. The GLM analysis was performed using FSL (version 5.0.9;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{Jenkinson_2012}</cite>) and implemented in Nipype (version 0.11.0;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Gorgolewski_2011}</cite>).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="187373" class="ltx_title_subsection">Simulation</h2><div>In order to validate the GLM  pipeline without gaining insights into potential results, we simulated data using the original data as a pedestal. The simulated data was designed to contain topologically distinct signals for both an average and habitual effect of familiarity. This way, it provided an opportunity to test the ability of our expanded second level  model to differentiate between these two kinds of signals.</div><div>The code used for this data simulation can be found in the scripts&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_functions.py</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>famface_simulation_main.py</i> and uses functions from PyMVPA <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Hanke_2009}</cite>.</div><div>First,  an initial motion correction was performed on each original image using FSL's MCFLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite> as implemented in Nipype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gorgolewski_2011}</cite>. A mean image was then computed for each functional run by averaging each voxel over its time points. This mean image was re-expanded to its original number of time points by adding temporally autocorrelated noise to each voxel.</div><div>The stimulus onsets for familiar and unfamiliar faces from the respective functional runs were convolved with a double-gamma function to model a BOLD response. To model an effect of familiarity, the amplitudes of these BOLD responses were chosen to be 8% signal change for familiar faces and 1% for unfamiliar faces respectively.</div><div>This modelled signal was then added to two arbitrarily selected ROIs defined in MNI space (radius = 10 mm; [x, y, z] coordinates were [10, - 94, &nbsp;4] and [14, 44, 12]) and projected into subject space using FSL's FLIRT&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jenkinson_2001,Jenkinson_2002}</cite>. For one of these ROIs, a habituation of the familiarity effect was mimicked by  increasing the amplitude of the modelled response to unfamiliar faces by 0.5 % signal change with each run number.</div><ul><li>Details about transformation method of ROI mask.</li></ul><div>The results of our GLM on the simulated data revealed that the modified second level model was able to differentiate between an average and a habituational effect of familiarity.
