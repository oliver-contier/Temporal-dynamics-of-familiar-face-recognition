<div></div><h1 data-label="797121" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The human face processing system consists &nbsp;of a core system associated with the analysis of  visual features of a face, and an extended system, involved in the representation of information that leads to socially-relevant behavior, such as person knowledge, emotional responses, and trait inference <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haxby_2011,Gobbini_2007,Natu_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>A central question pertains the temporal dynamics of these areas, and how core and extended system interact to generate the behavioral advantage for personally familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2013; Visconti di Oleggio Castello &amp; Gobbini, 2014; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2015; Visconti di Oleggio Castello et al., 2016; Ramon et al., 2016; Burton, bruce, etc.).</div><div></div><div><span>Previous studies on habituation, adaptation, and learning:d</span></div><div><span>So far, studies investigating such changes in the response to faces largely used paradigms like repetition suppression and adaptation (e.g. EEG repetition suppression in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Caharel_2011}</cite>; fMRI adaptation in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Eger_2005}</cite>; more references in these two papers). However, such methods zoom in on changes on a very short time scale and effects are generally interpreted more in terms of functional localisation, but are not very informative to the question of how the neural representation of face familiarity changes over a longer (and possible more naturalistic) time scale.&nbsp;</span></div><div>Two previous fMRI studies have focused on the changes in familiarity effects over a longer time scale (<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Gobbini_2006}</cite>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp*{Kosaka_2003}</cite>).</div><div></div><ul><li>but focused only on the acquisition of a representation for unfamiliar faces.</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="602375" class="ltx_title_subsection">Learning of unfamiliar faces (induced visual familiarity)</h2><div>For instance, it is unclear how the representation of a previously unfamiliar face might change while becoming visually familiar, without acquiring any personal knowledge about that person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006).</div><div>FFA:</div><div>This has been  proposed to coincide with a more efficient analysis by the early visual areas  of the "core system" (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2006).</div><div>Amygdala:</div><div>The amygdala - an area associated with the  evaluation of emotionally relevant stimuli (Breiter et al., 1996; Canli et al.,  2002; Morris et al., 1996; Zalla et al., 2000) - has been shown to respond more  strongly to unfamiliar than familiar faces (Gobbini et al., 2004; Leibenluft et  al., 2004). This has been interpreted as a state of alertness when encountering  an unfamiliar person (Gobbini &amp; Haxby, 2007). However, this effect has been  known to decrease upon repetition of the stimulus (Dubois et al., 1999, Kosaka  et al., 2003; Schwarz et al., 2003).</div><div>Precuneus:</div><div>Furthermore,  visually induced familiarity has been shown to evoke increased activity in the  precuneus - an area associated with long-term memory retrieval (Burgess et al.,  2001) and imagery (Fletcher et al., 1995; Ishai, Ungerleider, &amp; Haxby,  2000). It has therefore been framed as a module involved in representing  episodic memories linked to a familiar face (2007). We therefore expect  activity of the precuneus in response to unfamiliar faces to increase during  the course of the experiment, resulting in a diminished contrast between the response  to familiar and unfamiliar faces in this region.</div>
